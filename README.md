**cc.py** is a user-friendly GUI tool designed to convert Windows cursor themes (`.cur` and `.ani` files) into a format compatible with Linux desktop environments.

This application provides a graphical interface for converting cursors using the `win2xcur` command-line utility.

It began as a simple bash script inspired by a forum request from `safeusernameig` to convert Project Sekai cursors for Linux Mint, and has since evolved into a modular Python application built with PyQt6.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have the following installed on your Linux system:

- **Python 3:** The application is built with Python 3.
- `pip` and `venv`: This is used to manage Python packages and create a virtual environment.
- `ImageMagick`: This is required by win2xcur for processing the cursor files.
- `zip`: This is the command-line utility used for zipping files. It is typically included with your Linux distribution.


## Building from Source

To build the application from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application directly:
   ```bash
   python cc_ui.py
   ```
5. Build the executable (optional):
   ```bash
   pyinstaller ccpy.spec
   ```
   
The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory.


## Configuration

The application uses a JSON file to define how Windows cursors are mapped to Linux cursors. A default mapping file is included with the application.

To use a custom mapping, you may provide your own JSON file with the appropriate cursor mappings. The format expects each Windows cursor name as a key with the corresponding Linux cursor names as a space-separated string value.
